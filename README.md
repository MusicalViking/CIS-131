# CIS-131: Web Development I

## Overview

Welcome to my CIS-131 repository! This collection contains my coursework and projects for the Web Development I course at the University of Maine at Augusta. As a second-year Computer Information Systems undergraduate, I'm excited to explore web development from a structured academic perspective as I have been working on Web Development for almost two years now.

## About This Course

CIS-131 is a core requirement in my degree plan that provides hands-on experience with:

- HTML5 and CSS3 fundamentals
- Responsive web design principles
- Front-end development best practices
- Web accessibility standards

## My Journey

While this course is a required component of my CIS degree, I'm particularly enthusiastic about expanding my technical skill set. Coming from my experience with MIT's Brave Behind Bars program, I'm looking forward to approaching web development through this new academic lens and building a strong foundation in modern web technologies.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, each containing:

- `apply/` - Hands-on exercises and practice files
- `lab2/` - Lab assignments and projects

## Technologies & Tools

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Visual Studio Code (personal preference)
- Notepad++ (course standard)
- Git & GitHub

## Connect

Feel free to explore my work on [GitHub (@MusicalViking)](https://github.com/MusicalViking) and reach out if you have any questions or feedback. I'm always open to learning and improving my skills!

## Note on Development Environment

While this course primarily uses Notepad++ for instruction, I've asked to use Visual Studio Code for my development work as it offers enhanced features and integrations that support my learning process and familiarity.
