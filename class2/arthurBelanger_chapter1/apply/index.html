      <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
      <p>
        I am using VS Code, I have been using this editor for over a year now. I
        am very<br />
        familiar with setting up HTML pages, CSS and JS but this is one of the
        required classes<br />
        I need to take for my degree progress. I am a TA for MIT's Brave Behind
        Bars helping teach<br />
        a class very similiar to this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking forward to this as I like to go over things and see if I
        missed anything,<br />I feel that makes you a better coder or what ever
        task you take on in life. <br />With that being said, if you would like
        me to help in any way or if there are students struggling, <br />I would
        love to help.
